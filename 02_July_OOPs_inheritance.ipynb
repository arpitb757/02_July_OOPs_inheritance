    "Inheritance in object-oriented programming is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties (attributes and methods) of another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the \"base class\" or \"parent class,\" and the class that inherits from the base class is called the \"derived class\" or \"child class.\" Inheritance is used to create a hierarchical relationship between classes, enabling code reuse and promoting the concept of specialization and generalization. It allows the derived class to inherit and extend the functionalities of the base class, reducing code duplication and improving code organization."

    "Single inheritance and multiple inheritance are two forms of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance: In single inheritance, a derived class inherits from a single base class. It establishes a one-to-one relationship between the derived class and the base class. The derived class inherits all the properties (attributes and methods) of the base class and can further extend or modify them. Single inheritance promotes simplicity and clarity in class relationships and is often used in many real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a derived class can inherit from multiple base classes. It allows a derived class to inherit and combine the properties of multiple classes. Multiple inheritance can be advantageous in situations where a class needs to acquire features from different classes. However, it can also lead to complexity and potential conflicts if not used carefully. Python supports multiple inheritance, but it is important to consider the design and potential issues when utilizing this feature."

    "In the context of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base class: Also known as a parent class or superclass, the base class is the class from which other classes derive. It provides the common properties and behaviors that can be inherited by the derived classes. The base class serves as a blueprint for creating derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Derived class: Also known as a child class or subclass, the derived class is the class that inherits from the base class. It extends or modifies the properties inherited from the base class and can add its own unique properties and behaviors. The derived class inherits the attributes and methods of the base class and can override or add new functionalities."

    "The \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance is denoted by a single underscore _ before an attribute or method name (e.g., _protected_attribute). Protected attributes and methods can be accessed and modified by the derived class but are considered conventionally non-public and are intended for internal use within the class hierarchy. Protected members are not enforced by the language, but their usage serves as a naming convention and a signal to other developers about their intended usage.\n",
    "In comparison, \"private\" attributes and methods, denoted by a double underscore __ before the name (e.g., __private_attribute), are more restricted. Private members can only be accessed and modified within the class that defines them and are not directly accessible in derived classes. Private members provide stronger encapsulation and information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Public\" attributes and methods have no special access modifiers and can be accessed and modified from anywhere. They are accessible by both the class that defines them and any derived classes."

    "The \"super\" keyword in inheritance is used to refer to the base class from within the derived class. It allows the derived class to invoke and utilize the methods and attributes of the base class.

The super().__init__() statement in the DerivedClass calls the __init__() constructor of the base class, allowing the derived class to initialize the attributes inherited from the base class. Similarly, super().base_method() is used in the derived_method() to call and execute the base_method() from the base class."
